# Getting-and-Cleaning-Data-Course-Project

This is an assignment for the course Getting and Cleaning Data. It is about one of the most exciting areas in all of data science right now: wearable computing. Companies like Fitbit, Nike, and Jawbone Up are racing to develop the most advanced algorithms to attract new users. The data represent data collected from the accelerometers from the Samsung Galaxy S smartphone. This is the website from where the data is obtained:

This is the data used for this assignment:

# Repository

This repository consist of:

- This README file, which tells you more about the dataset and how it is created
- The CodeBook, which explains all the variables and calculations
- R script: run_analysis.R
- Textfile: run_analysis.R

# Assignment

Create one R script called run_analysis.R that does the following:

1. Merges the training and the test sets to create one data set.
2. Extracts only the measurements on the mean and standard deviation for each measurement. 
3. Uses descriptive activity names to name the activities in the data set
4. Appropriately labels the data set with descriptive variable names. 
5. From the data set in step 4, creates a second, independent tidy data set with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
6. Upload the data as a textfile. 

The result is in the textfile: run_analysis.R 

In this script:

- A file has been created and the datafile has been downloaded and unzipped.
- The names of the variables have been uploaded.
- The tables have been read into R (The training files and the test files).
- Then the files have been merged.
- The measurements of the mean and SD have been abstracted.
- The descriptive names have been labeled. 
- A second independent data set has been created, with the average of each variable for each activity and each subject.
- A textfile has been created. 

The comments in the script provide more information about the steps
